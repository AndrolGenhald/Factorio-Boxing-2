# Factorio Boxing Mod

Inspired by [Xecutor's Boxing mod](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=94&t=7481), rewritten to add items dynamically.

I haven't been able to find the time to play Factorio as much lately, so this isn't maintained very well. If an update breaks it, I'd be happy to merge a pull request to fix it.


## TODOs

 - Add setting for boxable subgroups
 - Add settings for stack sizes
